1. Identify Potential Duplicates
SELECT
    LOWER(TRIM(name)) AS normalized_name,
    COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count,
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT source) AS sources
FROM
    companies
GROUP BY
    LOWER(TRIM(name))
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;

2. Normalize the Data
WITH RankedCompanies AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY LOWER(TRIM(name))
            ORDER BY
                CASE source
                    WHEN 'MANUAL' THEN 1
                    WHEN 'API' THEN 2
                    WHEN 'SCRAPER' THEN 3
                    ELSE 4
                END,
                inserted_at DESC
        ) AS rank
    FROM
        companies
)
INSERT INTO normalized_companies (name, canonical_website, address)
SELECT DISTINCT
    name,
    website AS canonical_website,
    address
FROM
    RankedCompanies
WHERE
    rank = 1;

3. Statistics on Sources
SELECT
    source,
    COUNT(*) AS company_count
FROM
    companies
GROUP BY
    source
ORDER BY
    company_count DESC;
